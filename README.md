### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a PhD candidate (2022~) @ Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China.
- ðŸŒ± My background is in hydrology, with a particular interest in multi-disciplinary hydrological fields, including the changes in hydrological processes in the context of a warming climate and enhanced human activities, the causes and consequences of hydrological extremes, and the associated effects on ecology and human systems.
- ðŸ¤” I'm also enthusiastic about unraveling the causes, processes and consequences of hydrological extremes using artificial intelligence techniques.
